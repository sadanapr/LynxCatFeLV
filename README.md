## Abstract
We combined two models -the SIR model for disease dynamics modified to take into account inter-species transmission, and the Rosenzweig-MacArthur for population dynamics, modified to look at prey-mesopredator-predator relationsto study the case of a Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) outbreak within the rabbitscats-lynx system in the Do˜nana Park in Spain. We performed sensitivity analysis of the parameters in order to determine the cause of infection in the lynx population, looked into different possible scenarios and performed stability analysis of equilibrium to study the system’s behaviour. Finally, we described and compared different conservation measures to prevent the lynxes from extinction. The esults suggest that the transmission of FeLV from cats to lynxes leads to an outbreak in the lynx population. Moreover, the most effective measure to prevent an outbreak is to vaccinate the lynxes against FeLV. The paper highlights that mesopredators play an important role in disease dynamics of apex predators and not only in the predator - prey dynamics.
