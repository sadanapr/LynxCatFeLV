	%abstract = {A rich body of theoretical literature now exists focused on the three-species module of intraguild predation ({IGP}), in which a top predator both attacks and competes with an intermediate predator. Simple models of intraguild predation are often unstable, either because one consumer is excluded, or because sustained oscillations emerge from long feedback loops. Yet, many natural {IGP} systems robustly persist. Standard models of intraguild predation simplify natural systems in crucial ways that could influence persistence; in particular, many empirical {IGP} systems are embedded in communities with alternative prey species. We briefly review the key conclusions of standard three-species {IGP} theory, and then present results of theoretical explorations of how alternative prey can influence the persistence and stability of a focal intraguild predation interaction.},

The model was tested with data from a long-term study of several feline populations. The study of stability shows that {FeLV} is maintained in the population with a stable equilibrium and a slight reduction of population size. Estimation of the transmission rate allows us to make a comparison with the values previously estimated in the literature. We compare the impact of mass vaccination or removal programmes in controlling {FeLV} infection, and conclude that vaccination is more efficient.},

	%abstract = {The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is considered the most endangered felid species in the world. To date, less than 200 animals remain in the wild. Low numbers and genetic uniformity may contribute to render this species particularly susceptible to infectious diseases. Different pathogens have been identified in Iberian lynxes; including several feline bacterial and viral agents. Within a 6-month period starting in December 2006, 12 lynxes living in the northern part of the Doñana area were found to be infected with feline leukemia virus ({FeLV}). Eleven of these animals were antigenemic, and four of them died in the wild in less than 6 months since the first infected animal had been discovered. The remaining viremic lynxes were captured and allocated to a quarantine center to stop the spread of the infection. An additional three animals died shortly in the quarantine center due to acute anemic disease. Sequencing of the envelope surface unit gene revealed a common origin for the {FeLV} found in all lynxes. The sequences were closely related to {FeLV}-A/61E, originally isolated from cats in the {USA}. Our data demonstrate that, similarly to {FeLV}, the introduction of a new or particularly pathogenic infection brought into the small population of Iberian lynxes by other wild carnivores or feral cats and dogs roaming in the same habitats have severe consequences. It could result in epidemics that have the potential to eradicate the entire lynx population.},

In the Iberian lynx, interspecific killing (without prey consumption) of some mesocarnivores, such as the Egyptian mongoose, genet, and red fox, has been reported. Although vaguely documented, evidence suggests feral cats fall victim to interactions with this apex predator. Here, we describe the first documented case of interspecific killing and partial consumption of a feral cat by an adult male Iberian lynx reintroduced in Southwestern Spain. Ulterior analyses demonstrated that the victim was viremic to feline leukemia virus. To prevent the dissemination of the virus and a potential outbreak in the Iberian lynx population, control measures, including the clinical evaluation of the male Iberian lynx, and intensive monitoring were implemented in order to detect intraspecific interactions. After 3 weeks, the lynx was evaluated, presented good condition and resulted negative to both {ELISA} and {RT}-{PCR}. Thanks to the long-term monitoring, this case could be detected and measures to prevent an outbreak could be implemented.},

	%abstract = {The wildcat is a protected species in Europe but the lack of information on its status in many areas of its distribution range is an obstacle to conservation initiatives. To assess the status of the species over a 54,300 ha Mediterranean protected area in southwestern Spain (Doñana National Park, {DNP}), we carried out track censuses during the wet season of 2007–2008 and 2008–2009 in 2×2 km2 quadrants and set camera traps from June 2008 to October 2010 in quadrants or nearby quadrants where cat tracks were detected. We detected a total of 52 cat tracks for both study years and identified six different individuals from 28 photographs taken at 12 out of 166 trapping stations. We hypothesized that the causes of the a priori surprising low abundance of the species in the area might be multifold and might be explained by the historic competitive exclusion of the species by the Iberian lynx, the decrease of rabbit population in the {DNP} during the past decades, the isolation of {DNP} from the nearest natural areas that could have slowed the recovery of wildcat populations after a species declining and a potential increased mortality rate over time due to disease transmission from domestic cats.},

	doi = {10.1137/16S015553},
	%abstract = {Mathematical models have proven useful in planning conservation efforts for threatened species. In this paper, we develop a model based on the Macquarie Island ecosystem, where native seabirds were threatened by invasive pest species. In particular, European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) destroyed seabird nesting sites, while feral cats (Felis catus) preferentially hunted rabbits but also consumed seabirds. Management strategies included releasing a rabbit-killing disease and shooting feral cats. We investigate the interactions between species in the ecosystem as well as conservation practices using analytical techniques such as the basic reproductive ratio (R0) and partial rank correlation coefficient analysis. The results of this study reveal that the important factors to disease establishment change depending on the ecological interactions present in the system. Additionally, we show that the interaction between disease and predation sometimes produces surprising outcomes. Overall, the results of the study demonstrate the need for mathematical modelling in the conservation process in order to anticipate the complex responses of an ecosystem to management practices. We conclude with a brief list of considerations for conservation planners dealing with ecologically complex systems in the future.},

	%abstract = {The feline leukemia virus ({FeLV}) is a retrovirus that affects domestic cats all over the world. Its pathogenic effects generally include anemia, immunosuppression or tumors. Dissemination over populations is linked to cat sociality, because the virus is transmitted by direct contact. Although the domestic cat is its common host, {FeLV} infection has also been described in some wild felids. In the Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus, some sporadic {FeLV} infection cases have been reported since 1994, but an outbreak with the involvement of several animals has never been described until now. During spring 2007, an {FeLV} outbreak hit the Doñana ({SW} Spain) population. The infection rapidly spread throughout the densest subpopulation throughout Doñana. Infected animals showed very acute anemic disease, most of them dying in {\textless}6 months. To avoid {FeLV} dissemination, a control program was carried out that included removal of viremic lynxes, vaccination of negative individuals and reduction of the feral cat population. The program was implemented both in Doñana and in Sierra Morena populations. In Doñana, around 80\% of the total lynx population and 90\% of the outbreak focus subpopulation were evaluated. Seven out of the 12 infected individuals found died and two reverted to latency; the remaining viremic animals have been kept in captivity. The outbreak appears to have been successfully confined to the subpopulation where the virus appeared and no more cases have been found since August 2007. In the larger Sierra Morena population, 8\% of the lynx population was surveyed. Thirty-four uninfected Iberian lynxes were vaccinated at least once. The {FeLV} prevalence was found to be 27\% in the Doñana population and 0\% in the Sierra Morena population.},
